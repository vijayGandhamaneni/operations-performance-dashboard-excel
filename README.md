# Operations Performance Dashboard (Excel)

## Business Problem
The business was experiencing fluctuations in delivery performance, with declining SLA in certain cities. Management required a clear, city-level view of order volume and SLA performance to identify operational bottlenecks and take corrective actions.

## Dataset
The dataset contains order-level operational data including:
- Order ID
- City
- Promised delivery time
- Actual delivery time
- Order amount

## Approach
1. Imported and profiled raw operational data.
2. Validated data quality and confirmed no major cleaning issues.
3. Created business logic to classify orders as SLA Met or SLA Breached.
4. Calculated delivery delays to assess severity.
5. Built pivot tables to analyze order volume and SLA performance city-wise.
6. Created a simple dashboard with a visual chart and business insights.

## Key Metrics
- Total Orders by City
- SLA Met Orders by City
- SLA Percentage
- Delivery Delay (Hours)

## Key Insights
- High-demand cities showed relatively lower SLA, indicating capacity constraints during peak periods.
- Certain cities exhibited increasing delivery delays, signaling the need for operational monitoring and optimization.

## Tools Used
- Google Sheets (Excel equivalent)
- Pivot Tables
- Charts
- Business KPI Analysis

## Outcome
This dashboard enables stakeholders to quickly identify underperforming regions and supports data-driven decisions for improving operational efficiency and SLA performance.
